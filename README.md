# Astromodeling

This project used a generic dataset from Python, "planets", and comprised of analysis of the metrics surrounding planets and their chances of discovery by certain methods (e.g., Astrometry, etc.).

This was a mainly Exploratory project aimed at refining my skills as a Data Analyst and prospective Data Scientist. There were no main Conclusions to be reached; rather, Advanced Analysis was performed and Machine Learning Models were built to practice my expertise in specific powerful models such as Random Forests and Logistic Regression.

Enjoy!
